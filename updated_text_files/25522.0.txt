What   chance Homo sapiens  survive    500 years?


We’ve     year. Like  insatiable glutton,  law  averages   home  roost. We ’ve   hint    1st  January, 66 people lost  lives   Jakarta floods. What     highlights reel   disaster movie franchise –  volcanic eruption  The Philippines, irrepressible bushfires  Australia, earthquakes  Russia, Iran, Turkey, India,  China. And speaking  China.
2020  brought home  fragile mortality   human race  sharp focus. As global Covid-19 deaths stoutly push past  grim 1 million marks,    choice   question  place   universe –    -conquering masters   domain,  mere tourists   ruthlessly apathetic ecosystem? Is  human race   ubiquitous -part literary arc  defines  story,  life,  civilization – ascent, apex,  descent? Maybe  Michael Jackson unveiled  moonwalk  1983,   Barack Obama stepped   White House  President   United States  2008,    MS Dhoni lifted  Cricket World Cup  2011,  peaked,   species,        steady unraveling.
500 years   long time. For context,  world population  1500 AD   mere 461 million. The 16-fold explosion    unprecedented  history,        tip   iceberg. Though fertility rates  dropping     people  foregoing  chance   babies,     crossed  threshold –  population projections   year 2050  9.8 billion,   2100   whopping 11.2 billion1. Somewhere  , Malthus  cackling   grave. The year 2500 suddenly   long  ,   conversation  - pertinent today. The Bulletin  Atomic Scientists   optimistic –  famed Doomsday Clock  maintain   closest  ‘midnight’ ( proximity  global catastrophe),   inception  1947. Global warming? Check. The threat  nuclear war? Check. Ongoing pandemic? Check, check, check.
And , hope floats,   reasons. Mankind     back   wall  ,     shoots  potential      make   2500 AD –  advent   basket  disruptive technologies (artificial intelligence, bio-enhancement, genetic engineering),  private sector focus  space exploration  terraforming,  good  fashioned human resilience. While    factors   doubt  critical  human survival,         pin  hopes  –  long-demonstrated history  surviving  nature,  universe,    -destructive tendency, throws  .
The Next Superman?
In  13th century,   Italian town  Pisa,  enterprising tinkerer developed   eyeglasses,   local friar  weakening eyesight2. All   sudden,  existed  external device   amplify  senses,  tool  gave   advantage  survival. Today, LASIK surgeries obviate    eyeglasses . Hearing aids give  gift  auditory perception back         world  muffled voices  unheard sounds. The iPhone routinely    augmented reality tool     measure  length  objects  front  .
But  real science starts   imagination ends – augmented reality glasses, smart wearables,  virtual reality tools   ubiquitous     decades. But   ? Science   answer,  ’  thrilling  scary. Artificial intelligence    stuff  fable,  filler   questions left unanswered. But , combined  bio-enhancement  genetic engineering,   lead   evolution     calling Homo nouveau3. Homo nouveau   smarter, faster,  agile,   equipped  adapt   promises    world   VUCA   imaginations. What    human   ?
They    small chip embedded   brain  utilizes artificial intelligence  enhanced sensory perception. What   ?

Bio-augmentation  limbs  organs, internal  external,      person       longer determined  birth,   simply  bought. All   sudden,  average Joe  run faster  Usain Bolt, swim   Michael Phelps, …fly? Maybe. Genetic engineering    missing link. Already   feverish conversations   dystopian future featuring designer babies   digital divide  simply   overcome    inbuilt  ’ DNA. The breakthrough  CRISPR-Cas9     key  unlock  mysteries  DNA manipulation. So   ’  food left? Our body   adjust  appetite . No water? Absorb humidity   air  specialized pores   skin. The human   2500 AD      recognize  today. That     shot.
Galactic Dominance
SpaceX, led   mercurial leader Elon Musk,    leader . The SpaceX Mars Programme  based    simple premise –   earth’ closest planet  terms  distance  terrestrial conditions, Mars     bet  colonization. Musk  invested billions  dollars   Mars Space Programme  remains  fervent believer   concept. And  tech visionaries, Musk   . Jeff Bezos,  richest man   world, owns Blue Origin,  simply aims  make spaceflight cheaper  incremental technological growth. Bezos,    online retailer  books  turned    -expanding behemoth,    man  thinks small. With    business leaders finding spaceflight  planetary colonization  tantalizing prospect,   inevitably   concerted push  developing  actual colony   planet. And   pull-factor   development starts hitting diminishing returns,     inevitable push factor  global warming    increase   eruption  pandemics begin    toll. It      feasible option  people  find  alternate home,    Mars,     Saturn’ moons.
A human colony  Mars sounds   concept straight   science fiction,     permanent station  Antarctica    decades ago. Mount Everest    unapproachable summit    ahead  planted  flag   peak. Today, hundreds  people  year attempt  climb. As spaceflight   reasonable,   urge  explore supersedes  inertia  investment,   closer    chance  survival – leaving planet earth   finding  home,    forgiving   follies.
The Human Spirit

The human race  survive  2500,      doubt. The real question ,   person  exists  2500,  bionic chips   bio-enhanced body structure   modified genetic code,  called  Homo sapien? Or  Homo nouveau   forward?
