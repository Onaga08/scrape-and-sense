Lessons   past: Some key learnings relevant   coronavirus crisis


“The      past,   prepared     future.”
Theodore Roosevelt
As  speak,  world finds  engulfed     worst crises  recent times. The global COVID-19 pandemic  caused -- disruption   public  economic life. Not   factories shut   supply chains abruptly stopped  millions  workers stranded,  festivals suspended, families separated  countries  public-healthcare systems put  tremendous stress. Such  scenario   -time  ,   world    pandemics   similar scale  nature ,    due struggle, emerged victoriously. As   experienced    remember,  SARS  MERS outbreaks   early 2000s presented  similar scenario,     lower rate  infection,   higher rates  morbidity. Going back   time,  1918 Spanish Flu brought  world      world war,   standstill. Considered    worst  modern-era pandemics,  Influenza pandemic affected -   world’ population  50 million lives. Yet, preventive measures   social-distancing, quarantine, mass-vaccinations, public support,  restraint  proved   successful    situations,   effective  occasional plague outbreaks   world. We face  similar situation today –  extremely infectious virus,    spread globally, confined people   homes   causing tremendous economic loss  minute economic activity remains suspended, affecting   government   industries alike. 
Can past similar incidents guide industries    times? Can  governments  note   public-policy measures adopted   Spanish flu, SARS  MERS outbreak helped  eliminating  pandemics?
What   Government learn?
The panic due   outbreak  COVID-19,   importantly,  lockdown measures  deal  ,   similar     1918 Influenza Pandemic,      commonly referred  ,  Spanish Flu. Large cities   world  put  strict lockdowns,  businesses worldwide    grinding halt  large chunks   population  bedridden.
The  consequences       observed   past  weeks – rampant unemployment, supply shortages,  heavy reliance  social security systems, causing  sudden strain  national economic resources.
Impact & Learnings
Information & Censorship
Effective  transparent communications      crucial   tools  disease control. Iran presents  great    damage    unleashed   media-blackout. Secondly, censorship        appease  masses   times. The long-term political impact  media censorship  manipulation  epidemic-related facts  China     . Still,  short-term international unrest  dissent   deteriorated international relations. At  risk  quoting  cliché     established Streisand effect,  truth   ,  matter   countries   hide .
Isolation, Lockdown & Distancing Mechanisms Work
The Spanish Flu spread  aggravated due   failure  policymakers  adopting effective containment measures. Research shows  US cities  undertook measures  reduce contact  citizens  early-1918 displayed significantly lower peak death rates compared  cities  failed     late  adopt disease containment policies.
To quote  results   2007 study, “Consistent   hypothesis, cities   multiple interventions  implemented   early phase   epidemic  peak death rates ≈50% lower        -steep epidemic curves. They  displayed lower cumulative mortality.”
                            1: Contrasting  Death Rates  Philadelphia . St. Louis   1918 Influenza Outbreak
1: Contrasting  Death Rates  Philadelphia . St. Louis   1918 Influenza Outbreak
As   guess, Philadelphia  late  levy restrictions  gatherings, parades,  social distancing measures,  St. Louis  .
From   study,    definition   popular phrase “flattening  curve” emerging –   spreading   rate  infection  time, enabling health care systems  treat people   staggered manner,  line   resources. And,   corroborate  result,   graph    study shows   trajectories    disease   cities   US.
Hence,    multiple debunking claims  social-distancing & lockdown   effective preventive mechanism, previous epidemics  taught    perform  marvelous job  ‘flattening  curve’.
Premature Relaxation   Disastrous
Social Distancing & Lockdown measures  effective,   sustained,      months,   things start  improve.
Markel (2007), shows  disastrous consequences   early relaxation  bans  public gatherings  St. Louis   death rates,   Spanish flu. The pullback  social distancing measures  pursue economic interests  premature  caused  sudden, unprecedented surge   number  deaths due   flu.

Another peak  death rates  observed   cities   relaxed distancing measures prematurely. Hence,   crucial    past artifact  governments compare  inconveniences   public & damage caused   economy due   measures,   benefits   nation  terms  human life saved,   make  call     restrictions   eased.
What   industry learn?
The industry  played  key role   obscure fight   worldwide outbreak. But  faces  fair share  challenges,   unprecedented times.
Supply Shortages, due  shut-  factories & production houses   uncertainty   production systems  resume  normal functioning.Transport disruptions, due  closure & quarantining  cities  state-borders; nation-wide lockdowns bringing  transportation   standstill; significant disruptions   supply-chains   goods.Labour issues,  restrictions  movement,  issues  labour welfare, unrest  employment security. This problem       labour force  migratory  nature.
Global industries  weathered  multiple natural disasters   epidemics   similar scale  nature. Their recovery-paths  immense strategic implications  current policy-makers  offer strategic insights, helping companies chart   short-term & long-term strategies.

Looking   retail sector   micro-lens, past crises show  demand trends vary  product categories,    post  crisis. The  categories  follow  trends:

Change  Consumer Behaviour
A peculiar outcome   epidemics     permanent  instilled  consumer buying trends   inflicted regions,  product categories – Fresh staples   sharp rise   demand  product hygiene & safety standards  ranked higher    consumers’ priority list. Hence,  advantage lies  producers   quickly integrate changed consumer-preferences   products, showcase product reliability & quality,  priced competitively,   prevalent context. Lastly, previous pandemics  consolidated  long-standing theory,   true     retail sector    consumer-centric industry   , – Consumer Loyalty    tested   times.

Implications
Almost  decades ago,  SARS outbreak  China  pushed entrepreneurs  established players  embrace  dawn   -commerce era. This outbreak  expected  accelerate   shift  conventional brick-mortar based commerce   centralized online cloud-store based mechanism. Survival,   FMCG sector  ,   decided   great extent   breadth   supply chain networks   ability  overcome severe bottlenecks.
The past  shown    established large-scale players  deep pockets  extensive networks,   likelier chance  tough    hard times,   regional players & SMEs make  , strengthened  community-support, empathy   importantly, local relationships.
What   fail  learn?
This global pandemic outbreak  made  thing painfully clear –    lack  global collaborative research  ways  combat  spread   infectious diseases. In  words  Johan Neyts, professor  virology  president   Belgian-based, International Society  Antiviral Research (ISAR), health authorities failed  incorporate  learnings   SARS outbreak   early 2000s, partly    economic crisis  2008  squeezed funds   potential research     undertaken  partly    lack  seriousness  authorities    efforts involved  dealing   future expected breaks  coronavirus due     strains  existence. 
The Way forward?
All   lessons    caveat – Things change  time. The modes  communication  changed. Both information & travel    accessible . We  fast planes & faster internet. We   healthcare capabilities    ,   perfect, healthcare system. In 1918, people didn’     virus  causing  pandemic     eradication.
