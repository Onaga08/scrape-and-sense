Rise  Electric Vehicles   Impact  Livelihood  2040


In 2020 India   5th largest automobile market   world. While  fact  good news   automobile industry,    bad news   environment. How? Well, India    3rd largest oil-consuming  Green House Gas (GHG) emitting nation. According   Assessment Report (AR6)   Intergovernmental Panel  Climate Change (IPCC),   2020 lockdown,    complete economy  shut  36   50 big cities  India  unhealthy air quality.
Taking  account  current situation    studies, vehicles annually contribute  290 Giga grams  PM2,    time,  8 percent  total GHG (Green House Gas) Emissions  India    transport sector   Delhi,  exceeds 30 percent     account   promises made  India  decreasing Carbon emissions NITI Ayog   electrify India’ 2W segment  2025   3W segment  2030. India  aimed  create 100 percent Electric Vehicle (EV)   2030. While experts    goal   ambitious   hybrid   Electric Vehicles (EVs)  Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs)     India   decade  India  ushering    goal    faster fashion. And   give    reasons  :
 So basically,   war  Ukraine  Russia    -ending  Russia   exporter  crude petroleum   world,  rates  petroleum   International market  skyrocketing  India   3rd largest oil-consuming nation  90 percent   oil   imported,  lot  India’ money   driven       controlled. Moreover,   lockdown people    stay  distance       people   afford     personal vehicles   public . This   India        largest market  automobiles,   population. The effect  rising oil prices (touching  100rs mark   )      products  , transportation costs increasing inflation  . 
Therefore  government  hoping  control  import bills  EVs (Electric Vehicles)  Hydrogen Running Vehicles. But ( matter    , ’     India) ’  catch   hasty push        increase  country’ import bill. How? Well,     EV components  imported  China,     worry , huge Indian Automobile Industries    make EVs (Electric Vehicles) completely made  India,      informed  smart consumer. 
Now ’    government     issue :
 Since battery costs 70 percent   total manufacturing cost   EV (Electrical Vehicle), MoRTH (Ministry  Road Transport  Highways)   ‘Battery   service business model. The government  allotted  budget   100 crores   latest budget. The government  working  applying  Fame II Policy    spend 86 percent  Consumer Incentives  10 percent  Charging Infrastructure. The government    attract FDIs      import  Li (Lithium)  make batteries. The government   promised  build charging infrastructure. 
The government   launched  -portal   -amrit.niti.gov  COP26 Summit  Glasgow. The portal   insight   major benefits   EVs (Electric Vehicles). The major benefits talked  :
 Zero Tailpipe Emission (ZTE) Lower Running Cost Lower Maintenance Less Tax Environmental Benefits Easy  Drive Quite
You  feel   government  adamant   “ICE  EV  2030” mission,  ’ talk   government  add   mission. The double Dividend Hypothesis  David Pearce  1991 states  environmentaltaxation  improve economic  environmental conditions  recyclingrevenues obtained  reduce  pre-existing taxes. Norway   toll  free parking  people  EVs   incentive. Sweden  France give tax levitation  people  EVs.
Now ’ chitchat  bit   problems  consumers      switch toEVs: Short driving range  EVs Long Battery Recharge Time Lack  charging Infrastructure Higher cost Battery life High cost  commercial electricity Poor roads
If India   forward   EV future     build  good road network   isproven  carbon emission  ICE  lesser  good roads   driving range  EVs  alsogreater  good roads.
Now ’ talk     affect livelihood   future    2040. So   give yousome       expert’ predictions  conclude  article : According  Crew Report demand  power  expected  rise  80 percent. About 75 percent  vehicles   EVs. This  usher     Railways  large distances. Let’  forget air transport  . Transportation cost  goods  decrease Imports  decrease  large amounts. Empty petrol stations (  converted  charging stations) And  writing   reading  -solarized EVs.
The    obvious (chuckles)     read   ,    share  small, additional  important information    summarized    prediction. So,    EV trade route      Philippines, Japan,   US. And  The Philippines extracts Ni (Nickel)  batteries  EVs  Rio Tuba,  mine, Japan purifies   The US makes batteries        EVs. Now  demand  increasing,  mining  Rio Tuba  increasing    affecting  Rainforests   Philippines   ecosystem, making  question “Is    solution?” 
And  I predict: High prices  nonavailability  batteries   parts   world.
