Will  Replace Us  Work With Us?


“Machine intelligence    invention  humanity     make”
Nick Bostrom

To put  frankly, Artificial Intelligence  eventually replace jobs. Workers   variety  industries,  healthcare  agriculture  manufacturing,  expect  witness hiring disruptions   result  Artificial Intelligence.
If history  taught  ,    disruptive paradigm-shifting business ideas   make  fortune   innovators,    build  groundwork   business models, market entrants,  job opportunities   inevitably follow. It  true  robots today   future  eventually replace humans   jobs,    innovative farming equipment  humans  horses   industrial revolution. But       jobs  humans  end . We,    hand,   required  generate  provide     ways    business models   result   .
According  71%   businesses worldwide, Artificial Intelligence   people overcome critical  challenging problems  live  lives. Artificial Intelligence consultants  work     equally fair,    whopping 83%  corporate leaders. These results demonstrate  Artificial Intelligence  steadily extending  measures, yielding societal benefits  allowing citizens  live  fulfilling lives.
Increase  Automation  Jobs  humans ’ compete
Since  advent  Industry 4.0, businesses  moving   fast pace  automation,    type  industry. In 2013, researchers  oxford university   study   future  work. They concluded       jobs   high risk   automated  machines. Machine learning  responsible   disruption. It    powerful branch  artificial intelligence. It  machines  learn  data  mimic    things  humans  .
A research  conducted   employees  Kaggle   algorithm    created   images   human eye  diagnose  eye disease   diabetic retinopathy. Here,  winning algorithm  match  diagnosis   human ophthalmologists. Another study  conducted   algorithm   created  grade high school essays. Here ,  winning algorithm  match  grade   human teachers.
Thus,   safely conclude     data, machines  easily outperform human beings  tasks  . A teacher  read 10,000 essays   40-year career;  ophthalmologist   50,000 eyes   machine  read  million essays    million eyes  minutes.
Thus,   convenient  conclude     chance  competing  machines  frequent, high volume tasks. 
Tasks  machines don’ work
But   tasks  human beings   upper hand,   ,   tasks. Machines ’ handle things  haven’   times . The fundamental rule  machine learning    learns  large volumes  past data. But humans don’;    ability  seemingly connecting disparate threads  solve problems  haven’  . 
Percy Spencer   physicist working  radar  world war 2   noticed   magnetron  melting  chocolate bar. Here,     connect  understanding  electromagnetic radiation   knowledge  cooking  order  invent  microwave oven. Now  sort  cross pollination        times   day. Thus, machines  compete       tackling  situations. 
Now       92%  talented professionals   soft skills   human interactions  fostering relationships matter    hard skills   successful  managing  workplace. Perhaps,    kind  tasks  machines   compete  humans . 
Also, creative tasks:  copy   marketing campaign   grab customers’ attention     stand    crowd. Business strategy means finding gaps   market   working  . Since machines  outperform humans   tasks,    humans    creating  campaigns  strategies. 
Human contact   essential  care-giving  educational-related work responsibilities,  technology    backseat. Health screenings  customer service face--face communication  advocate  human contact,  Artificial Intelligence playing  supporting role. 
So,       future  work? The future state   single job lies   answer   single question:   extent   job reducible  tackling frequent high-volume tasks    extent   involve tackling  situations?

Today machines diagnose diseases  grade exam papers,   coming years ’   conduct audits, ’   read boilerplate  legal contracts. But    ’     needing accountants  lawyers? Wrong. We’       complex tax structuring,  path breaking litigation. It    tougher    jobs  machine learning  shrink  ranks. 
Amazon  recruited   100,000 robots   warehouses   move goods  products   effectively,   warehouse workforce  expanded    80,000 people. Humans pick  pack goods (Amazon   480,000,000 products   “shelves”),  robots move orders   enormous warehouses,  reducing “ amount  walking required  workers, making Amazon pickers  efficient   exhausted.” Furthermore,  Amazon  longer requires aisle space  humans,  robots enable Amazon  pack shelves   cars  rush-hour traffic.” More inventory   roof offers  selection  customers,   higher density  shelf space equals  inventory   roof.
Kodak Vs Instagram
Kodak,   undisputed giant   photography industry,   90% share    market  1976,   1984,   employing 1,45,000 people. But   year 2012,    net worth  negative $1 billion     declare bankruptcy. Why? Because  failed  predict  importance  exponential trends     technology. On   hand, Instagram,  digital photography company started  2012  13 employees     sold  Facebook  $1 billion. This   ironic  Kodak pioneered digital photography   invented   digital camera   thought     mere product  didn’ pay attention     created  problem.  
We live   era  artificial intelligence (),     tremendous computing power, storage space,  information access. We    spinning wheel   , electricity   ,  computers    industrial revolution   exponential growth  technology.
Airbnb   breakthrough idea!
Airbnb,    giant start-     enabling homeowners  rent   homes  couches  travellers,  , “  creating   Artificial Intelligence system   empower  designers  product engineers  literally  ideas   drawing board  convert   actual products  instantly.” This    significant breakthrough  ’  designer, engineer,   type  technologist.
Differences  Automation brings   table: 
There   key   automation  bring    macro level: 
Changes  capability demandGender imbalance  workforce redeploymentFirm reorganization. 
Sectors     trouble
Artificial Intelligence isn’   fad. Tractica,  market research firm, published  report  2016  predicted “annual global revenue  artificial intelligence products  services  expand  643.7 million  2016  $36.8 billion  2025,  57-fold increase   time span.” As  result,    IT industry’ fastest-growing segment   size.”
The reduction    people   result  Artificial Intelligence  related technologies,  resulted  job layoffs,     fear. In India , job losses   IT sector  reportedly reached 1,000    year, owing   integration    advanced technologies  artificial intelligence  machine learning. 
Most   IT companies   Infosys, Wipro, TCS,  Cognizant  reduced  employee base  India   recruiting ,  engaging  personnel   United States  investing heavily  “centres  innovation.” Artificial Intelligence  data science,     trending aspects  require fewer people   primarily located abroad, aren’ helping  prospects  local employees. Another factor    computer industry  continuously growing   develop   size   million workers. Unfortunately, ’  drop   bucket compared   robots    Information Technology’ -skilled brothers. 
Large -commerce sites     operated  armies  people   manned  200 robots produced  GreyOrange,    Indian company based   Gurgaon. These indefatigable robots lift  stack boxes 24 hours  day,    30-minute break  recharging,   cut employees    80%. For efficiency,    victory   disaster  job prospects. 
Concluding remarks
Internal -skilling  redeployment  staff   critical requirement   hour. Artificial intelligence  presented Indian policymakers  epistemological, scientific,  ethical issues. This requires   abandon regular, linear,  -disruptive mental patterns. The tale  artificial intelligence’ influence  individuals   occupations    told  time. It      upskill     ways  stay current   industry’ current trends  demands. 
So,  machines         jobs? The answer   resounding . However,   job      robots,     equal number  positions   people  . Some   human vocations   artistic  nature. Others  necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities. Humans  machines  form symbiotic relationships, assisting        . In  future, people  machines     collaborate  work    common goal   business  work .
