                               IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON  ENERGY MARKETS
In India, distribution utilities   lower tariff  domestic  agricultural consumers,     average cost  supply,  compared    commercial  industrial consumers. Table 1   electricity tariff rates  Delhi  selected consumer categories  highlight  differences. Thus,   distribution companies,  lower tariff-paying consumers  cross-subsidized  commercial  industrial consumers.

The COVID-19 lockdown  led  shut     essential commercial activities   country. Approximately 1.3 billion citizens  obliged  remain   confines   homes ,   cases,  allowed  work  home. Consequently,  electricity demand  industrial , commercial customers  reduced significantly   residential demand  expected   increased.
