How prepared  India  tackle   COVID-19 outbreak?


Frankly, ! The state   public healthcare system,  vast,   fragmented   scale  rapidly   face  challenge   pandemic   COVID-19. The origin  public healthcare lies   British colonial period   facilities  provided   British officers   families stationed  India. From  1960s onwards,  independent government  India stressed   healthcare   led   creation   modern public healthcare system  India. The healthcare system  organized  primary, secondary,  tertiary levels. At  primary level  Sub Centre’  Primary Health Centre’ (PHCs). At  secondary level   Community Health Centre’ (CHCs)  smaller Sub-District hospitals. Finally,  top level  public care provided   government   tertiary level,  consists  Medical Colleges  District/General Hospitals. The number  PHCs, CHCs, Sub Centre’,  District Hospitals  increased   past  years,          standards set  Indian Public Health Standards. But    critical challenges   existing system.
One   major areas   lack  awareness  diseases,  communicable diseases   general population  India. This challenge   complicated   lower strata  society,  poor households, migrant laborers  homeless people      proper channels  communication      information   health experts. Add low educational status, poor functional literacy, low accent  education   healthcare system,  low priority  health   population,       magnitude   problem. According   recent study initiated   faculty  students  IIT-Hyderabad  IIT-Bombay,  Tier-1 cities,   found   12 percent   respondents switched  public  private mode    week  COVID-19. This modal shift   9 percent  Tier-2 cities   7 percent  Tier-3 cities. Moreover,  48 percent  people      travel  work    week  March,  28 percent    frequency  travel  work. When inquired   cancellation  trips   cities  major modes  transportation,  18 percent   cancelled  flights , 20  cent  respondents cancelled  train journeys. This   awareness  COVID-19  higher  Tier-1 cities,  comparison  Tier-2  Tier-3 cities. But national level, state level  door--door campaigns   targeted media campaigns  enable  knowledge   pandemic  spread fast   local populace.
The  challenge  access  public healthcare  India. Access ( healthcare)  defined   Oxford dictionary  “The   opportunity    benefit  (healthcare)” Physical reach     basic determinants  access, defined  “  ability  enter  healthcare facility  5 km   place  residence  work”. Using  definition,  study  India  2012 found   rural areas,  37%  people    access IP facilities   5 km distance,  68%    access -patient facilities. Furthermore,   postulated   general,   rustic (rural) ’ existence –    lives  towns –  greater   odds  disease, malnourishment, weakness,  premature death.
The    planning portion related   preparedness   pandemic. Planning   pandemic   COVID-19     extensively  India     recent history    communicable disease  spreads rapidly  crowded locations,    quarter   population live . The recent national lockdown called led   increase  police violence     sensitized   deal    crisis   humanitarian crisis facing migrant laborers,  important part   Indian economy,   lost  jobs  facing  lack  public transport,   force  walk thousands  miles  reach  native villages. The ongoing slump   economy    exacerbated   pandemic   resultant lockdown. And    growing complaints  healthcare professionals,   fighting   front   pandemic,  lack  Protective Personal Equipment’ (PPE’)  protect    patients  COVID-19. The lockdown  hit HIV+  chronic patients hard   constant medication  maintain  fragile condition. Elderly people,       medical conditions,   left  essential support. Ironically,     group  people      threat  COVID-19.
I  optimistically hoping, based   ingenious  creativity   citizens,   tide   tough times  fundamental    healthcare system  made   sober learning experience  prevent  repeat    happening today.
