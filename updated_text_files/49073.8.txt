Celebrities      transition  politics    grace,   learned  live   public’ eye,  established , allowing  carry-   - traits  celebrities   role  policy-makers. The visibility  autochthonous politicians work years  nurture, celebrities     descend   political sphere. In    - instances   celebrity transitioning  politics, Ronald Reagan walked   Hollywood    White House, carrying    trademark charismatic -screen personality  spilled    politics. Initially serving   governor  California  15 years   late 1960s, Reagan served  terms   Oval Office. The voters knew  Ronald  –   closely   trends   red  blue –      , giving Reagan  edge  propelled   success. On   side   globe, India     trend   -screen persona aiding  creation   -screen political career.

Very ,  sentiment  anti-incumbency     golden ticket  lets celebrity politicians snatch political power  consummate politicians. Indeed,  political theorists suggest  anti-incumbency       effective strategies  secure vote banks. Until 31st December 2018, Ukrainian actor, screenwriter,  director Volodymyr Zelensky  played  lead   sitcom  tells  story   schoolteacher  accidentally   president.

Time    deliver  verdict. But  gushes   invoked   people  Ukraine,   plea  oust ‘ ruling class’ played  role  assuring Zelensky 73%   plebiscite. In  early 2010s  India, similar anti-incumbent sentimentalities  played     celebrities including musician Vishal Dadlani, hockey legend Dhanraj Pillay, singer Jaspinder Narula,   –    joined hands  Arvind Kejriwal’  ‘Aam Aadmi’ movement  aimed  rid  existing political system   ills.
