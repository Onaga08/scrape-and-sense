Ray Hammond commented   healthcare     2040: 
“Healthcare      arenas         stake. The  20 years  witness  profound change  healthcare,    notable   medical science  healthcare delivery tend   conservative, slow-moving sectors   highly resistant  change. The annual global market   estimated   worth  $8.1 trillion,  annual global spending  healthcare forecast  rise  $18.28 trillion  2040. 
With   mind,    collective responsibility       generation  determine   change      impact       .” How    health promote economic growth? First, fewer people    die prematurely   working-age population  increase. When people  healthier, absences  sickness decline  workers   distracted  managing  conditions     loved . Also, fewer workers retire early   health conditions.
The COVID-19 pandemic  hit people  underlying health conditions hardest— , diabetes, hypertension,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder,  obesity,   common     world’ economies.

Among  report’ key healthcare predictions  2040 :
• Health information  traditional annual physical check-ups   tests previously    surgery  lab   replaced  data  sensors /  ‘smart’ bodies (including   clothing , eventually, skin  blood). This   immediately accessible  ,  real-time.• A  field  ‘predictive medical data mining’  provide early warnings  physiological trouble ahead  indications  disease   develops. Physicians   24/7 real-time reports   patients’ wellbeing    alerted   change  patients’ data  requires urgent attention.• Stem-cell medicine    powerful tool  mainstream medicine. For , replacement human organs  transplant   grown  demand  stem cells   lab,  minimal risk  rejection• Nano-medicine (  infancy  2019)  eventually outperform   branches  medical science,  scientists create ‘designer drugs     powerful  today’ drugs• Artificial Intelligence () ‘chatbots’ equipped  deep learning algorithms  relieve emergency room personnel  tending  large numbers  walk- patients  -emergencies (.. sore throats, UTIs).

The 10 archetypes  fall   distinct,  interconnected, categories:
