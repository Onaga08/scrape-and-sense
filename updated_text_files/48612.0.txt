Collectively,   stages epitomize  inescapable   time:  battle

What   government ?
The government    measures  order  manage  pandemic. The  steps   recognition    scenarios   Indian economy  enable policymakers  identify  countermeasures  stem  spread   pandemic:
Build  national database   reachable physical health infrastructure  medical  para-medical resources The public  private health care facilities   segregated  labeling  section  accessible hospital beds  treating COVID-19 patients  Extend additional -time budgetary support  augment  public health care system  terms  facilities, equipment,  human resources capacity Earmark financial resources  provide -time grants/financial support  research institutions  leading pharmaceutical/biotechnology/medical equipment companies Extend  coverage  Ayushman Bharat   applicable insurance schemes  COVID-19    included Tweak  existing customs duty structure  select components,   essential  manufacturing testing kits, ventilators, .Enable access  funds  businesses  run  day  day operations  service  debt Ensure  smooth supply  essential products  commodities    economic impact   COVID-19 outbreak Provide credit support  Medium  Small Enterprises Encourage investments   -time set   capital investments made  corporates  income-tax computations
Therefore,  question remains   stimulus     –  quantitatively  qualitatively? Would       economy absorb  shock   lockdown? Compared     (2 trillion USD), Germany (610 billion USD), UK (424 billion USD), France (335 billion USD), Spain (218 billion USD), China (78.8 billion USD)  Italy (27.3 billion USD),  spending  India (1, 70,000 crore – 22.5 billion USD)  prima facie    insufficient. However,   comparison   easy  straightforward   lot  factors      account. In addition,  important factor     considered     point  time  country    spend     . Against  revised budget estimate  Rs. 21,63,000 crore  2019-20  Tax collections,  collection   31st Dec 2019    tune  Rs. 13,83,000 crore     huge shortfall. In addition,  substantial amount      spent   tackle  pandemic    utmost priority. On top  , huge additional spending  jeopardize  fiscal deficit discipline ,  times  emergency, fiscal deficit     matter  concern  .
 It        long  virus continues  affect India     hygiene standard  herd mentality   ,  virus continues  affect   3 months  extends  6-8 months,    packages   grossly insufficient   money     pumped   economy. If   arises, currency notes     printed  circulated  concerns  higher fiscal deficit   simply pushed   backseat. The corporate sector   section  large-hearted people    forward   time  distress  support  government initiatives  fighting  menace   provide  financial comfort   Government.
The pandemic  appeared     potential death knell   World economy     stress  India   exception. There    opinion   pandemic  hit  world  hard   continue      foreseeable future. Whether India  emerge   medical pandemic     economic pandemic  unscathed remains   . We     care   lives     livelihoods   citizens. As Indians,  hope,   overcome.  Together       .
