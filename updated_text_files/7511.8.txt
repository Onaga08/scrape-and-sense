Oil prices   year 2040,     impact  world economy.


We    interconnected world. Any change   part   world   lead   #   parts   world  ,   bit   surely     change         today’ world. Electric vehicles   change      today’ world. With   advancements  technology, economies   bigger. China  surpass  US    #superpower,    India inching   15 trillion economy  2040     competition    outshine  . We     paradigm shift    multipolar world   unipolar world  powers  moving   clusters   world       part   clusters. But    rearrangements taking place. We     creating     sustainable life   present     future generations. 
We  witnessed  COP26    leaders  top countries taking pledges  create   sustainable future   answer lies   safer  greener planet  electric vehicles occupy  huge chunk  . Internal combustion engines   peaked,  electric vehicles   cheaper  cheaper  governments   country  actively pushing  electric vehicles      joint statement  Cop 26  “As business fleet owners  operators,  shared mobility platforms,   work  100%   car  van fleets   emission vehicles  2030,  earlier”. This   step   future. India   home   large number  -wheelers  -wheelers constitutes   70%  global sales    80%  India    signatory   statement.   And   analyze  properly- crude oil, coal,  gas    demanded natural resource    world. But ’  free    latest scenarios     world, ’ #  switch    safe, efficient,  affordable electric vehicle.
If     economic aspects  electric vehicles,   surely improve  livelihood  society   turn  world. EVs   track  rise  20%  China’ total market  2025,   6%  2020,   37%   EU,  11%  year. In  U.S.,   forecast  reach 10%  2025. India    lagging. India’ EV market   nascent   forecast  record  2.4% CAGR  2020  2025. Electrification  expected  penetrate cars  -mile connectivity modes  -wheelers  India  2030. It  expected  70%  -wheeler fleets  30%  private -wheelers   electric  2030. For passenger vehicles, 40%  fleets  15%-20%  private cars   electric   time.  There    steps    government  #tax exemptions, schemes  PLI, FAME,  battery swapping policy. We   note    estimated   10 million direct jobs   created  indirectly  50 million jobs   created   sector. If     global picture         price parity  battery vehicles  ICE vehicles     advancements  technology     prices  batteries coming    players  involved    prices estimated    .
As  world leader, countries  China       race  build  lithium-ion batteries     -sufficient    capabilities   rise   occasion    major exporters   world. The European Union    lagging       catch   producing  batteries   -sufficient  2025.


Crude oils  increasing day  day. We    shortage  gas  European countries  due   Russia- Ukraine war      find  alternative  gas  crude oil    harmful  ’    main reasons  pollution    havoc   world. One   major problems  Crude oils  oil spilling   endangering marine species. Air pollution caused due  petrol  diesel vehicles   affecting  planet      oil     pollution  alternative drivetrains, fuel economy,  shared mobility  impact oil demand; , nations  won’ reach net-  2050   . Coal    great contributor   pollution Environmental impacts    coal   energy source  particulate emission, ground-level ozone, smog,  acid rain. Coal  fuel oil combustion emit fly ash particles   atmosphere,  contribute  air pollution problems. Though     prices  crude oil haven’ peaked ,   surely peak  2040. So,    foresee  future    alternative  society    ’ reach  complete outwash  oil  2050   make    alternatives  ready  -sufficient.
Well, job opportunities    major reason     EVs   future. We realize   max range   electric vehicle    350-390 km  people   stop   recharge  batteries    40-50 minutes   provide  time frame   people  avail restaurants explore shopping complexes   . This    generating employment opportunities  #hubs  . There    rush  countries  China,  ,   European Union  build charging stations     accelerate  process  EV vehicles. In  fast, paced world   alternative family    car   public vehicles  buses  trains   changed  electric vehicles   boost  economy     creating greater    opportunities   sectors   transportation  communication     building block  today’ nation-building process. 
However,    talking   world   greener  fitter   realize  understand  Electric vehicles    cost   planet. There   huge amount  electric waste       today’ world. It    concern   world    planning  live . Electric vehicles  batteries  rare materials    easy  find. Electronic waste,    -waste,   electronic product,  product  electronic components,   reached  end   usable life cycle. Unbeknownst   consumers, electronics  toxic substances –     handled  care   longer wanted  needed.

Therefore,      focus  solely electric vehicles     kinds  fuels  green hydrogen fuels  ethanol    generated  agricultural waste. Companies play  important part   change. Rather  making   electric,     make vehicles   hybrid  nature. They  switch engines     ready  switch  petrol  diesel  green hydrogen  ethanol    electric vehicles. The future  …It’ time  act!
