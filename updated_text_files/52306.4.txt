When
 British ruled India,  Indians
accepted  work   policy,       rebel   British 
 presence  Indian lands; They recognized  benefits  British rule. What
  factor  made Indians accept 
British government? The perception 
British-policies ( trading, pay-scale,  positioning   military)  
   marketing channels       brainwashed people   nation,    ready  accept  British. So  Marketing   fire  smartly
handled;   destroy  enemies,      burn .  
Marketing   design  develop  pathway  product  service   customer   product, price, place  promotion strategies. Marketing depends   variety  parameters    classified broadly, boiling   vital . These  ‘What type  customer  marketing team  focusing  (based  gender, age, location, customer-class) (W1)’, ‘What  Product Specification  Applications    bring  front  customer (W2)’, ‘What   Product Promotion flow path (W3)’, ‘How  time  takes  convey product information  customer (H1)’. These criteria   I call ‘3W1H’ forms. These basics     care   developing  marketing strategy   upcoming product. However,   ? No. There    parameter called  Feedback mechanism (FM). Generally, machines   feedback mechanism  check output generated    input         ,  input  corrected    required output.

So ’ elaborate  3W1H approach works   feedback mechanism. 

          Fig.1- 3W1H  FM process  target customer effectively          
After deciding  customer range,   work  
activities. Since  customer 
conscious  purchasing  product 
  product promoted,   thing  customer  check  
usefulness,   / answer  ‘Yes,’
  customer  start comparing  similar alternative products  
market. Therefore,   present 
product    unique thought
 express  product       image imprinted   consumer
mind. For ,  polio campaign 
India. The government    initiative  make India polio-free 
spreading awareness   types  social communication mediums,  
Television played  vital role. Legendary
cinema actor ‘Amitabh Bachchan’  selected   ambassador   campaign.
Initially,  advertisement published   Amitabh pleaded people  vaccinating
 children   fixed schedule. The advertisement circulated   nation, 
 stone   unturned   government
 make  campaign successful. However,
   surprise, advertising failed miserably  attract  deprived community  polio booth. This promotion failure   
-consideration   customer (W1)
  advertise impacted  application   customer (W2)? So  analysing failure, experts recommended 
  marketing campaign ,  focus  major customer (Here 
village woman  generally spend  time  home  watching TV), type 
impact  people (People  watched TV   era,   image 
Amitabh  ‘Angry young man’). So  campaign
improved  advertising  bringing    angry Amitabh  
 soft-image,     earlier campaign. So     polio
campaign number  people   polio booth suddenly increased  
feedback    people    sudden change,  replied

For
  factor (H1) time,  obvious question    mind   ‘Is time  advertising matters?’, While
watching  TV   advertisement appears,
 times  change  channel  
watching   ad  ignore  altogether. You    option  ‘Skip ad’   watch  online,    decide   time  required
 deliver product information  
promotion? Delivering product information
  time,  create  possibility   customer  watch   
 result  attracting  customers. So,  content   
king   marketing. However,  
  guessed ,    work   time. Other factors   cost   product,
application range, type  customer   affect
 H1. For ,  customer  
 conscious  watching higher-priced

product image generated  customer’ minds  dealers   feedback-form. Not   feedback mechanism  lead  failure  achieving
‘product sales target’   make  situation  worse. Take    ‘THE TATA Nano-MAKING OF WORLD’S
CHEAPEST CAR,’   mind-blowing ---kind projects  Indian
automobile industry. From   phase   marketing
campaign, TATA Nano    
continuous limelight   project  pleased   American president
Barack Obama.[ii]
The curiosity   product
  high   sale  -leading
car model Maruti-800  dropped  20% immediately  unveiling  Nano.[iii]
However,  marketing  product,  organization built “Affordable, Garibo Ki Car” image  customer’ mind,
 made customers conscious      status-quo  society
 buying Nano? Thus,  started giving preference  -wheelers  Nano. During   time,  instances  Nanos catching fire 
 focus,  worsened  situation.
This case  exacerbates   team
