How Data Analytics      halt  COVID-19 Pandemic?


Even  COVID-19    halted    facing  nth wave   coronavirus outbreak   countries,  notably  US, India,  Brazil. It   fact  Data Analytics     big guns   artillery   fight   COVID-19 pandemic. It  helped    stages   outbreak,   detection    outbreak, vaccine development  manufacturing contact tracing,  future hotspot detection. Some   interesting applications  discussed   article.
A lesser- fact    COVID-19 outbreak   detected  Toronto, Canada,  7,230 miles     outbreak,  days   WHO issued  warning. It      Big Data Analytics  ,  specifically Deep Learnings (DL,  subset  Machine Learning) application  Natural Language Processing (NLP)  analyze text inputs  traced  surge  pneumonia cases   Wuhan province  China. The specialty  DL algorithms    mimic  brain cells called neurons   identify patterns  Big Data. This DL-backed software    inputs, reports  public health organizations, global airline ticketing data, . These    flag unusual surges  potential spreads  infectious diseases.
The  application  Big Data Analytics      Research  Development  drugs  halt COVID-19.     analyze  protein structure   virus, findings   significant   progress  vaccine development. In preliminary studies,   found     mutate  fast   viruses   HIV,  means   prophylactic vaccine      proceed    therapy. But     evidence supporting  fact    find  kind  cure  ,    chance   virus mutating,    happened  major mutations   found   UK, Brazil,  South Africa.   assisted scientists  rapidly shortlisting  set    vaccines    effective   coronavirus.
Another interesting application     found   selection    candidates, ..    test positive  testing coronavirus  case  insufficient testing resources. This method   exercised  Greek borders   called project . Whenever  traveler wanted    Greece,    fill   form   Passenger Locator Form (PLF)   24 hours prior  arrival,  information   origin country, demographics, point,  date  entry,   intended destination.   allocated testing resources    size   set  passengers   tested. After  test results,  found positive,   put  quarantine. The results   back   program  real-time learning.
The question remains   made allocations, It  found , statistically,   origin country   city  significant factors  screening. Ultimately,   variety  countries  city pairs,    predict   testing resources    allocated   entry point    passengers   location  technically called  Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem,   chosen method  solve  problem    algorithm called optimistic Gittins index. This algorithm identified  average 1.85x   asymptomatic, infected travelers  random surveillance testing,    2-4x    peak travel. After  test results,  found positive,   put  quarantine. Following  collection  significant data   aforementioned process,    period, policies  made categorizing  separately  imposing restrictions  travelers   specific location. This   presented    operation  August 6th  November 1st processing  38,500 PLFs  day  testing   average 18.5%  households entering  country  day.
Above mentioned applications  show  tip   iceberg            developments  watch  include    Image Recognition  identify covid based  -ray images,    Deep Learning  predict  3-D protein structure   COVID-19   .
